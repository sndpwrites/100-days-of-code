# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Sass tutorial at http://sass-lang.com/guide. Completed the git basics at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1


**Thoughts:** CSS basics is fun. TMI. Need to get back to writing blog posts soon. Medium maybe? We'll see.
