### Day 2: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt usage of function arguments, optional arguments, object, properties and arrays in Javascript. Tried few code exercises at http://eloquentjavascript.net/

**Thoughts:** As someone who has usually worked mostly with OOP concepts, Optional arguments was a bit weird for me. Loved the elegance and simplicity of JS codes though.
